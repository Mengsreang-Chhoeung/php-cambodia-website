          <b>Cambodia</b>( Khmer: កម្ពុជា ), officially the Kingdom of Cambodia
          (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា), is a country located in the southern
          portion of the Indochina peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is 181,035
          square kilometres (69,898 square miles) in area, bordered by Thailand
          to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east and the
          Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. The sovereign state of Cambodia has
          a population of over 15 million. Buddhism is enshrined the
          constitution as the official state religion, and is practised by more
          than 97% of the population. Cambodia's minority groups include
          Vietnamese, Chinese, Chams and 30 hill tribes. The capital and largest
          city is Phnom Penh, the political, economic and cultural centre of
          Cambodia. The kingdom is an elective constitutional monarchy with a
          monarch, currently Norodom Sihamoni, chosen by the Royal Council of
          the Throne as head of state. The head of government is the Prime
          Minister, currently Hun Sen, the longest serving non-royal leader in
          Southeast Asia, ruling Cambodia since 1985. In 802 AD, Jayavarman II
          declared himself king, uniting the warring Khmer princes of Chenla
          under the name "Kambuja".[10] This marked the beginning of the Khmer
          Empire, which flourished for over 600 years, allowing successive kings
          to control and exert influence over much of Southeast Asia and
          accumulate immense power and wealth. The Indianised kingdom
          facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to much of
          Southeast Asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects
          throughout the region, including the construction of more than 1,000
          temples and monuments in Angkor alone. Angkor Wat is the most famous
          of these structures and is designated as a World Heritage Site. In the
          fifteenth century, after the rebellion of Ayutthaya, which was
          formerly ruled by the Khmer Empire, Cambodia experienced the decline
          of power. Cambodia faced two increasingly powerful neighbors,
          Ayutthaya of Thailand and Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam, and marking the
          downturn of Cambodia's fate. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate
          of France, and later was incorporated into French Indochina of
          Southeast Asia. Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953. The
          Vietnam War extended into the country in 1965 with the expansion of
          the Ho Chi Minh Trail and establishment of the Sihanouk Trail. This
          led to the US bombing of Cambodia from 1969 until 1973. Following the
          Cambodian coup of 1970 which installed the right-wing pro-US Khmer
          Republic, the deposed King Sihanouk gave his support to his former
          enemies, the Khmer Rouge. With the support of the monarchy and North
          Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge emerged as a major power, taking Phnom Penh
          in 1975. The Khmer Rouge then carried out the Cambodian genocide from
          1975 until 1979, when they were ousted by Vietnam and the
          Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, supported by the
          Soviet Union, in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. Following the 1991
          Paris Peace Accords, Cambodia was governed briefly by a United Nations
          mission (1992–93). The UN withdrew after holding elections in which
          around 90 percent of the registered voters cast ballots. The 1997
          factional fighting resulted in the ousting of the government by Prime
          Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party, who remain in power
          as of April 2020. Cambodia is a member of the United Nations since
          1955, ASEAN, the East Asia Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement
          and La Francophonie. According to several foreign organisations, the
          country has widespread poverty, pervasive corruption, lack of
          political freedoms, low human development and a high rate of hunger.
          Cambodia has been described by Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian
          Director, David Roberts, as a "relatively authoritarian coalition via
          a superficial democracy". Constitutionally a multi-party liberal
          democracy, the country is de facto governed under one-party rule as of
          2018.
