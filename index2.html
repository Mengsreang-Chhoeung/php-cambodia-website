            <b>Cambodia</b>( Khmer: កម្ពុជា ), officially the Kingdom of
            Cambodia (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា), is a country located in the
            southern portion of the Indochina peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is
            181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) in area, bordered by
            Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the
            east and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. The sovereign state
            of Cambodia has a population of over 15 million. Buddhism is
            enshrined the constitution as the official state religion, and is
            practised by more than 97% of the population. Cambodia's minority
            groups include Vietnamese, Chinese, Chams and 30 hill tribes. The
            capital and largest city is Phnom Penh, the political, economic and
            cultural centre of Cambodia. The kingdom is an elective
            constitutional monarchy with a monarch, currently Norodom Sihamoni,
            chosen by the Royal Council of the Throne as head of state. The head
            of government is the Prime Minister, currently Hun Sen, the longest
            serving non-royal leader in Southeast Asia, ruling Cambodia since
            1985. In 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the
            warring Khmer princes of Chenla under the name "Kambuja".[10] This
            marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire, which flourished for over
            600 years, allowing successive kings to control and exert influence
            over much of Southeast Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth.
            The Indianised kingdom facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and
            then Buddhism to much of Southeast Asia and undertook many religious
            infrastructural projects throughout the region, including the
            construction of more than 1,000 temples and monuments in Angkor
            alone. Angkor Wat is the most famous of these structures and is
            designated as a World Heritage Site. In the fifteenth century, after
            the rebellion of Ayutthaya, which was formerly ruled by the Khmer
            Empire, Cambodia experienced the decline of power. Cambodia faced
            two increasingly powerful neighbors, Ayutthaya of Thailand and
            Nguyen dynasty of Vietnam, and marking the downturn of Cambodia's
            fate. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate of France, and later
            was incorporated into French Indochina of Southeast Asia. Cambodia
            gained independence from France in 1953. The Vietnam War extended
            into the country in 1965 with the expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail
            and establishment of the Sihanouk Trail. This led to the US bombing
            of Cambodia from 1969 until 1973. Following the Cambodian coup of
            1970 which installed the right-wing pro-US Khmer Republic, the
            deposed King Sihanouk gave his support to his former enemies, the
            Khmer Rouge. With the support of the monarchy and North Vietnam, the
            Khmer Rouge emerged as a major power, taking Phnom Penh in 1975. The
            Khmer Rouge then carried out the Cambodian genocide from 1975 until
            1979, when they were ousted by Vietnam and the Vietnamese-backed
            People's Republic of Kampuchea, supported by the Soviet Union, in
            the Cambodian–Vietnamese War.
